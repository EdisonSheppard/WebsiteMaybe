Safety Guidelines:

Emphasize the importance of using the printer in a well-ventilated area due to potential fumes from some filaments (ABS).
Warn users about the hot nozzle and bed, advising them to avoid touching these elements during printing.
Highlight the importance of keeping flammable materials away from the printer.
Briefly discuss electrical safety and proper grounding practices.
Printer Maintenance:

Explain routine maintenance procedures like cleaning the nozzle and bed after each print.
Provide instructions for filament loading and unloading, emphasizing proper techniques to avoid jams.
Briefly discuss lubricating moving parts (depending on the printer model) to ensure smooth operation.
Advise users to consult their printer's manual for specific maintenance recommendations.
Troubleshooting Filament Issues:

Explain how to identify and address common filament problems like jams, clogs, and brittle filament.
Provide tips for storing filament properly to prevent moisture absorption, which can lead to printing problems.
Calibrating the Printer:

Briefly explain the importance of printer calibration for optimal printing results.
Focus on basic calibration procedures like bed leveling, ensuring proper nozzle-to-bed distance.
Advise users to consult their printer's manual or online resources for detailed calibration instructions.
Training the AI for Safety and Maintenance:

Include a dataset of user queries related to safety concerns and common maintenance issues.
Train the AI to identify potential safety hazards based on user descriptions of their printing environment.
Equip the AI with solutions and preventative measures for common maintenance problems.
The AI should be able to direct users to relevant resources for printer-specific calibration procedures.
