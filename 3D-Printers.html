    <img src="/3D-Printers/bambulab.webp" width="400px">
    <p>The Bambu Lab P1S stands out for its lightning-fast printing speeds and user-friendly features.  It boasts a large build volume, making it a great choice for tackling sizeable projects. Material versatility allows you to experiment with various filaments. However, this top-of-the-line performance comes at a premium cost.</p>

    <div>
        <div class="pros">
            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Excellent print quality and speed: The P1S uses a Core XY design which allows for high-quality prints at faster speeds than conventional printers.</li>
                <li>Enclosed design: This allows you to print with high-temperature filaments and fumes are contained. It also reduces noise and keeps dust out.</li>
                <li>Multi-color printing: The P1S can print with up to 16 colors, which opens up creative possibilities for your projects.</li>
                <li>Easy to use: The P1S comes with a user-friendly interface and automated features that make it easy to set up and use, even for beginners.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="cons">
            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased filament waste: The P1S purges filament before every print, which can lead to some waste.</li>
                <li>Limited filament compatibility: While the enclosure allows for high-temp filaments, some parts are not user-replaceable, so sticking with Bambu Lab filament is recommended.</li>
                <li>Noisy: Compared to some printers, the P1S can be a bit noisy due to the enclosed design and high-speed printing.</li>
                <li>Closed ecosystem: Bambu Lab parts and filament can be more expensive than generic options.</li>
            </ul>
