Explain the basic principles of 3D printing, including Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) as the most common technology.
Define key terms like filament, slicer software, build plate, and nozzle.
Briefly discuss different types of 3D printers (filament, resin, etc.) and their pros and cons.
Document 2: 3D Printing Workflow

Outline the typical 3D printing workflow:
3D Modeling: Explain the use of 3D modeling software and common file formats (STL, OBJ)
Slicing: Describe the role of slicer software in preparing the model for printing, including concepts like infill density, supports, and layer height.
Printing: Explain the printing process, filament loading, and bed leveling procedures.
Post-Processing: Discuss removing supports, cleaning the print, and finishing techniques (sanding, painting).
Document 3: Troubleshooting Common Issues

Identify common printing problems like:
Print Quality Issues: Stringing, warping, layer separation, under/over extrusion.
Bed Adhesion Issues: Prints not sticking to the bed.
Calibration Issues: Issues with nozzle temperature, bed temperature, or flow rate.
Failed Prints: Prints not completing due to software errors, power outages, or filament jams.
For each issue, provide:
Clear descriptions with pictures or diagrams for visual reference.
Step-by-step troubleshooting steps with potential causes and solutions.
Document 4: Material Guide:

Discuss different types of 3D printing filaments (PLA, ABS, PETG, etc.) and their properties (strength, flexibility, heat resistance).
Provide recommendations for filament choice based on the desired application of the printed object.
Include tips for proper filament storage to prevent moisture absorption and printing problems.
Document 5: Advanced Topics (Optional)

Introduce advanced concepts like:
Dual extrusion printing and its applications.
3D printing with support materials.
Calibration techniques for advanced users.
Discuss resources for further learning, including online communities, tutorials, and forums.
Additional Considerations:

Train the AI with a dataset of user queries and solutions from existing 3D printing forums and support channels.
Integrate the AI with a knowledge base that can be updated with new information and troubleshooting solutions.
Develop the AI to understand natural language and respond to user questions in a clear and concise manner.
Consider incorporating visual recognition capabilities to analyze pictures of failed prints and suggest solutions.
